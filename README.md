Cool is a small language designed for use in an undergraduate compiler course project. While small enough for a one term project, Cool still has many of the features of modern programming languages, including objects, automatic memory management, and strong static typing. Cool is built entirely on public domain tools; it generates **LLVM IR**. Thus, the project should port easily to other platforms. The project has been used for teaching compilers at many institutions and the software is stable.
